# Efisiensi Pengelolaan Feedback MBG
This project aims to create a simple program to process feedback related to the Makan Bergizi Gratis (MBG). The goal are:
1. Developing an algorithm for processing MBG consumption data;
2. Identifying the most preferred and least consumed food types;
3. Generating data-based automated feedback for MBG managers. The MBG system is designed to provide real-time data on food consumption patterns, enabling managers to optimize food supply and reduce wastage. The system also generates automated feedback based on consumption data, allowing managers to identify trends and make informed decisions.

# Features
The features included in the program are:
1. Stemmer
   The program can manipulate the prefix(es) and suffix(es) in a word to match the keyword(s).
2. Normalize Bigram
   The program can process some words into a detectable words to ease the feedback data analyze.
3. Multiple feedback(s) input
   The program can analyze multiple feedback as determined in the start.
4. Evaluation based on the feedback keyword(s)
   Some keywords are categorized as a binary (positive or negative) valued word to give an overview of the MBG performance.
5. Feedback analyzer
   The program can analyze word(s) that match the programmed keyword to be showed in the output.
7. Frequently occuring word sorter
   The program will sort the word(s) that matched the programmed keyword and order it from the most to the least occuring word.
