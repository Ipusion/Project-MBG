# Efisiensi Pengelolaan Feedback MBG
This project aims to create a simple program to process feedback related to the Makan Bergizi Gratis (MBG). The goal are:
1. Developing an algorithm for processing MBG consumption data;
2. Identifying the most preferred and least consumed food types;
3. Generating data-based automated feedback for MBG managers. The MBG system is designed to provide real-time data on food consumption patterns, enabling managers to optimize food supply and reduce wastage. The system also generates automated feedback based on consumption data, allowing managers to identify trends and make informed decisions.
